# 1337-Projects

Welcome! This repository documents my journey and solutions for the projects at **1337 (42 Network)**. It serves as a personal log of my progress, a portfolio of my work, and a place to showcase the skills I've learned along the way.

My journey starts with the C Piscine (The Pool) and continues through the Common Core Cursus.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: The 42/1337 Honor Code

At 1337/42, the core philosophy is peer-to-peer learning and solving problems yourself. Directly copying and pasting code (cheating) is strictly forbidden and will result in a grade of -42, a "Cheat" flag on your profile, and potential expulsion.

You are encouraged to look at this code for inspiration or to understand a difficult concept *after* you have already spent significant time trying to solve it yourself. **Please respect the honor code and do not plagiarize.**
